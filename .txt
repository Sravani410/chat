      //sending to all clients,include sender(socketid)
      io.emit('message',"this is a test")

      //sending the all clients except sender
      socket.broadcast.emit('message',"this is a test")

      //sending to clients in "game" room(channel) except sender
      socket.broadcast.to('game').emit('message','nice game');

      //sending to clients in "game" room(channel), include sender
      io.in('game').emit('message','cool game');

      //sending to sender client, only if they are in "game" room(channel)
      socket.to('game').emit('message','enjoy the game');
